   ## What is this about?

   This is a repository of all my exercises, labs, and other activities in **CSDC105** *Trends in Application Development*

   ## What software/application is very much needed in the world today?

   Today for me is the communicating apps like facebook, because a lot of people can't go out and interact to others/ love ones. Also in facebook you can go there and buy on somethings.Plus it will save you some time you just have to tap tap on your screens.
